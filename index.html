            <h1 class='title'>Is MJ Actually the GOAT?</h1>
            <p class='opening'>With the recent release of the 'Last Dance' documentary centered around the 97-98 Chicago Bulls, I began
               to wonder what makes Michael Jordan the greatest basketball player of all time? Throughout this career, he 
               has amassed an insane collection of awards: 5 MVPs, 6 Finals MVPs, 1 DPOY, 12x All-NBA, 10x All-Defense. Obviously
               these awards stand as a testament to the dominance he had on the NBA so I decided to dive into the major statistics
               that are utilized to compare players.

                    <p> Individual statistics are a great way to compare a player's progression or regression
                        across their career. It allows for the comparison of a player's performance from season to season. 
                        The graph to left currently displays Jordan's career averages. By using the dropdown under it, you 
                        are able to track how Jordan's stats change year to year.

                    <p>Individual statistics also serve as the the primary comparison between different players. Although 
                        the game and rules of basketball are always changing, these stats still provide great insight in comparing
                        players that played in the same era or different. On the graph to the right, you can compare Michael Jordan's 
                        career stats to the likes of other all time greats. Larry Bird, one of the best shooters the game has ever seen 
                        combined with an all around game where he constantly among the leaders in assists and rebounds. Magic Johnson, the
                        greatest passer of all time. LeBron James, arguably the greatest athlete to play basketball whos passing ability and 
                        scoring ability both rank among the best all time. I chose these three because in my opinion, these three plus Jordan 
                        are the greatest small-ball players of all time.

                Now obviously there are aspects of the game of basketball that also attribute to a player's
                greatness that do not show up in the stat sheets as well as the evolution of more modern advanced
                analytics that are much more complicated to quantify. However, I still believe that these core statistics
                easily convey a players' skillset and overall impact in the game and can be used to form a conclusion on 
                who is the greatest NBA player of all time. And that player is
